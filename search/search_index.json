The game is a FPS shooter game that is similer to the game Overwatch, where there are different characters with different abilities to chose from. Where did you learn to do networking? The networking is a extension of Tom Weiland's Networking Tutorial! Schedule? Currently there is no Schedule for the game, and I have no idea when release will be available. Current Dev Team Currently, the game is a solodev where I do everything. Though I might look for some modelers in the future! Will I be making YouTube videos on the progress? Most likely not, I do not know how to edit videos and I don't think people would want to hear my voice for 10-30m","title":"About HeroClash"},{"location":"DevLogs/AboutHeroClash/#hero-clash","text":"","title":"Hero Clash"},{"location":"DevLogs/AboutHeroClash/#gameplay-options","text":"SinglePlayer (Complete Story Mode) Multiplayer (PVP with other players)","title":"Gameplay Options:"},{"location":"DevLogs/AboutHeroClash/#what-is-the-game-about","text":"The game is a FPS shooter game that is similer to the game Overwatch, where there are different characters with different abilities to chose from.","title":"What is the game about?"},{"location":"DevLogs/AboutHeroClash/#where-did-you-learn-to-do-networking","text":"The networking is a extension of Tom Weiland's Networking Tutorial!","title":"Where did you learn to do networking?"},{"location":"DevLogs/AboutHeroClash/#schedule","text":"Currently there is no Schedule for the game, and I have no idea when release will be available.","title":"Schedule?"},{"location":"DevLogs/AboutHeroClash/#current-dev-team","text":"Currently, the game is a solodev where I do everything.

Date: (07/11/21 - 07/18/21) Monday: I started by creating my first Server in C# After I completed the console I kept on working on the game and I finished TCP and UDP connections between server and client! I finished the day by creating a player controller. Tuesday: I started working on the Interpolation and Ticking system and didn't get too far. Wednesday: I converted my server to a Unity Project and I also finished the Ticking system and continued working on interpolation. At this point the Interpolation was working other then the server keeps on slingshotting the player every tick. Thursday: I thought I finished interpolation, but sure boy, I was wrong. It was working in single player, but whenever I host a multiplayer server it slingshotted the other player across the galaxy. Friday: I got most of the interpolation fixed exept every time you move it slingshots the player. Interpolation Bug Saturday: I decided to put Interpolation on hold for now since it was taking up many days and I wanted to get more Core Mechanics done. Today I added Hero Chosing Systems, Added Shooting, Hero Movement, Implemented the first hero (Wizzo), Added Abilities, and Added Headshots to the game.
