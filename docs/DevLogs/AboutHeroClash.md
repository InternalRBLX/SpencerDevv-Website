## What is the game about?

The game is a FPS shooter game that is similer to the game Overwatch, where there are different characters with different abilities to chose from.

The networking is a extension of Tom Weiland's Networking Tutorial!

Currently there is no Schedule for the game, and I have no idea when release will be available.

Currently, the game is a solodev where I do everything. Though I might look for some modelers in the future!

## Will I be making YouTube videos on the progress?

Most likely not, I do not know how to edit videos and I don't think people would want to hear my voice for 10-30m
