After I completed the console I kept on working on the game and I finished
TCP and UDP connections between server and client!

I finished the day by creating a player controller.

### Tuesday:

I started working on the Interpolation and Ticking system and didn't get too far.

### Wednesday:

I converted my server to a Unity Project and I also finished the Ticking system and continued working on interpolation.

At this point the Interpolation was working other then the server keeps on slingshotting the player every tick.

### Thursday:

I thought I finished interpolation, but sure boy, I was wrong.

It was working in single player, but whenever I host a multiplayer server it slingshotted the other player across the galaxy.

## Friday:

I got most of the interpolation fixed exept every time you move it slingshots the player.

### Sunday:
